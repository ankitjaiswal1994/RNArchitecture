# RNArchitecture

This is the boiler plate of react-native project. We made it for crownstack which was a service based company, Idea behind this was to keep everyone align to follow the same code and pattern.

# Highlight of the architecture

- We use typescript within our project. We recommend have a basic look on the typescript before you proceed further. (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/overview.html). We will try conclude that what you need to learn about the typescript later.
- We use 100% functional component with the help of hooks. We find it neat and clean. We recommend you to do so.
- We are following shopify restyle. (https://github.com/Shopify/restyle)
- We have created predefined atoms and molecules within this boiler. Basically a wrapper of react native UI component like View will refer to Box. Will write better explanation for this.
- We use react-native config for handling multiple environment like dev, qa, staging and production. (https://github.com/luggit/react-native-config)
- We do not encourage to directly use string within our project instead use Localization. We are i18n-js for that. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-i18n)
- For state management we use context api and it has been setted up in the project. Do not use redux we not want to merge redux and context.
- We use Icomoons for using svg icons within the project and there is already created atom for that named Icon. Benefit of using icomoons is we can send updates of icons without uploading it on stores i.e on the air as icomoons doesn't linked on the native side. (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icomoon)
- We encourage to use `react-native-size-matters` to scale the size on the phones for larger or smaller phones even on iPad. (https://github.com/nirsky/react-native-size-matters)
- We use `https://github.com/DylanVann/react-native-fast-image` to chache image.
- We use `https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/blob/master/docs/quick-start-react-native.md` to debug the build.

# StoryBook Setup

## Add Storybook:

`npx -p @storybook/cli sb init --type react_native`

Note: If you get an option to setup server press 'Yes' and set it up.

- Now if you check the project structure it adds storybook folder and some scripts on package.json.
- Now run `yarn storybook`. It open the storybook server and run the index.js file which is inside storybook.
- It keeps shows loader on the UI. So to encounter this in App.jsx. Export storybook. And run the server again now you can see the storybook enabled and working.
